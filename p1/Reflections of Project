You've learned a lot about web development so far:::
-------------------------------------------------

* What new skills have you learned?
 I have learned new tags and how to make web pages by using required tags


* What has been easy?
  
 The easy part was that i was able to make little of web pages due to the earlier tags that i have learned .
 
* What has been difficult?
to be honest in starting it was not that easy even i was having a little knowledge of tags but though by learning new tags it made my work easy.


* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I have consulted my friends and in case of new tags i took yhe help of web by using various sites to know these things.
